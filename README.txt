Q1: Adjacency
- created "Class Graph" with "struct Vertex" and "struct Adjacency"
  - 
- functional

Q2: Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation
- created dijkstra(int pos) and findPath(Vertex* v)
  - dijkstra is implementation of Algorithm
  - findPath prints the pathing in a adjacency list/table
- functional
